# C_lab_2sem
This repo contains my own solutions to the tasks I was given during the lab classes of Procedural Programming course, which I took in the 2nd semester of my Applied Computer Science studies at AGH University of Cracow.
The tasks mainly concerned topics such as memory management in C, dynamically allocated arrays, string operations, linked lists, using qsort and bsearch in arrays, compilation using makefile, writing to a file and reading from a file.
